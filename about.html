<div class="about-section">

<p>
I’m <strong>Parth Soni</strong>, a Senior Data & AI Solutions Consultant with 8+ years of experience architecting enterprise-grade platforms for real-time analytics, cloud data engineering, and AI-driven business transformation. I work with companies as a <strong>solution provider, freelance architect,</strong> and <strong>technical advisor</strong> to design and deliver systems that scale with confidence.
</p>

<p>
My work spans multiple architectural patterns—<strong>modern data lakehouse, event-driven systems, streaming analytics, microservices-based data platforms,</strong> and <strong>GenAI retrieval pipelines</strong>. I bring deep experience across multi-cloud ecosystems and help organizations modernize, migrate, and accelerate their data & AI strategies.
</p>

<p>
As an <strong>AWS Community Builder</strong> and an active contributor to cloud & AI communities, I regularly speak at events and publish insights on data platforms, streaming systems, and enterprise GenAI adoption. I collaborate with global clients across finance, healthcare, retail, and SaaS to deliver measurable outcomes through engineering excellence.
